This project is for the class **BAIS Professional Preperation**, and is intented to familarize students with the GitHub platform. 

# Description 
Our amazing professor, Kristin Earens, provided in depth instructions that directed us to take one of the GitHub Skills Lab, Intoduction to GitHub. Through this skills lab, we learned about repositories, branches, commits, pull requests and contributions. Now we are creating this Hello-World repository to get us even more famaliar with GitHub. For the purposes of this assignment, I will be talking about a Python code sample I completed for my Computational Thinking class this semester.
